# Speech-Recognition

I developed a small application using C#'s speech recognition libraries during my high school years. 
It uses defined commands that I added to the database.
The program runs in the background of the computer, waiting for a command, and performs the function you have defined for the recognized command through voice input.

- For example, if you tell it to open Google Chrome, it will open a Google Chrome tab, or you can quickly open a game or an actively used application by defining it and using voice commands.
